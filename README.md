# G2i React Web Test - Trivia app
created by Jess Scheuring (aka @NicerHugs)


## Running in a dev environment

### Install the app

From your command line in the app directory, run `yarn install` (or use npm, or npx if you prefer).\
This will download all app dependencies and install them to your machine.

### Run the apple

Run `yarn start` , which runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## App tooling
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This is a trivia app that relies on the following libraries for basic functions:
- React - components and local state management
- React Router - page navigation
- Redux Toolkit Query - shared state, data fetching and caching

## UI and UX
I have chosen to leave this app as simple as possible from a design perspective, closely following the provided wireframes, with a few added elements to improve UX (such as buttons for navigating through the quiz questions). Due to the styling simplicity, no css pre-processor has been utilized.
